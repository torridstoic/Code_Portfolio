Money Manager Android

What This Is: This is the Android demo build I made near the end of the main project development cycle. The initial goal was to port the entire app into an Android build, but we were unable to discover how to connect our database, so I was only able to implement a demo version: it shows functionality and some layout ideas, but does not save data between uses.

Development Comments: Xamarin (for VisualStudio) was used for the Android development. This allowed me to code for Android in C#, which I'm familiar with, instead of Java.

How To Use: Set MoneyManager.Android as the startup project, build, and run. An Android phone will need to be connected, or an emulator used.
