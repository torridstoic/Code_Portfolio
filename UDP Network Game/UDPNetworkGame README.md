## Network Game (Pong)

* **What This Is:** This is a networked game (Listen Server and Clients), similar to Pong. The game resources, structures, and algorithms were pre-made.
* **How To Use:** Two instances must be run, joining the same game lobby. The game will then begin, and each instance will affect the gamestate of both.
* **My Contribution:** I wrote the networking & communication aspect of this game, allowing messages and game snapshots to be sent (and received and parsed) between the server and players.
* **My Files:** /Application/Server/Server.cpp and /Application/Client/Client.cpp (and edits to associated .h files).
